		My name is Lindsey Rappaport and I'm currently a student at UCSD, where I'm working on my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I earned my Associate in Science for transfer in Mathematics from Palomar College at the age of 18 after graduating from high school a year early. I'm an enthusiastic extrovert with a love for creative problem solving. In addition to being a student researcher at LBNL where I work on a metabolic pathway visualization project, I am a private tutor for grades K-12.
