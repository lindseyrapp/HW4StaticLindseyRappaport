# Reflecting on My Research Internship

I had an incredible experience during my research internship at **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** in 2021. Some highlights:

- Building a **visualization tool** for metabolic pathways.
- Learning to navigate large-scale biological datasets.
- Collaborating with researchers from different disciplines.
- Improving my **data visualization** skills.
- Improving my graphic design and data embedding skills.

This experience strengthened my ability to tackle open-ended problems, something thatâ€™s very different from coursework. It made me more confident in my ability to **learn on the fly** and apply computer science to **real-world science problems**. I was even asked to stay on as an employee, and I am still working on this project to this day!
