# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my new blog! I'm Lindsey Rappaport, a Computer Science student at UCSD. This blog will document my journey through learning web development, my research projects, and my personal experiences as a student and developer.

Expect posts about:

- Cool things I learn in class
- Projects Iâ€™m working on
- Tips for fellow students
- Reflections on internships and research

Thanks for stopping by!
