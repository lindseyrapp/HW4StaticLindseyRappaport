# What I Learned in CSE 110

CSE 110 at UCSD was a hands-on experience that taught me:

- The importance of **Agile development** and how to work in **sprints**.
- How to effectively collaborate with a team using **GitHub Projects**.
- Writing user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Performing **code reviews** and writing **pull requests**.
- Documenting architectural decisions with **ADRs**.

One key takeaway was how important **communication** is when working on a team. Even the best code doesn't matter if the team isn't on the same page!
